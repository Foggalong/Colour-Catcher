Colour Catcher
==============

A simple program which analyses the colours used by selected file(s). I made this when working on simplifying [Naut CSS](https://github.com/Axel--/Naut-for-reddit) but decided it might be fun to extend it's capabilities. Some examples of it's analysis can be found [in the wiki](https://github.com/Foggalong/Colour-Catcher/wiki).
